# CrowdEncode

CrowdEcode - Fire-Flask 

CrowdEncode is a simple platform for coding/classifying unstructuctured text data. Distributed teams of experts can collaborate to create qualitative coding schemas, as well as use these schemas to classify data. Moreover, users can convert their projects into a crowdsourcing tool for building massive sets of textual data. 

This repository provides the code base for the CrowdEncode prototype. The system is built using Python, Flask Microframework, Jquery, and Firebase.
